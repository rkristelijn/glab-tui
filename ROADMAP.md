# 🚀 glab-tui Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Mission: Beat glab CLI at its own game!

**Current Status:** TUI is 2.5x faster but shows wrong data  
**Goal:** Speed + Accuracy = TUI DOMINATION 🏆

## 🔥 IMMEDIATE FIXES (Next 2 Hours)

### **Priority 1: Data Accuracy** ⚡
- [ ] Fix token parsing from glab config (!!null issue)
- [ ] Implement real-time pipeline fetching
- [ ] Show current pipelines, not cached data
- [ ] Test with Pipeline Q's current pipeline (1997149474)

### **Priority 2: Project Context** 🎯
- [ ] Auto-detect project ID from GitLab context
- [ ] Fix "no project ID configured" errors
- [ ] Support running from any GitLab repository
- [ ] Proper project path resolution

### **Priority 3: Real-time Updates** 📊
- [ ] 3-second auto-refresh implementation
- [ ] Live job status updates
- [ ] Pipeline state change notifications
- [ ] Real-time log streaming

## 🏆 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### **Pipeline Q's Test:**
```bash
npx glab-tui                    # Must show pipeline 1997149474
```

### **Performance Target:**
- **Speed**: ≤ 0.214s (maintain 2.5x advantage)
- **Accuracy**: 100% (match CLI data quality)
- **Freshness**: Real-time (not hours-old data)

### **User Experience:**
- **Zero config**: Works out of the box
- **Visual superiority**: Better than CLI commands
- **Keyboard driven**: Faster than typing commands

## 🚀 PHASE 2: TUI SUPERIORITY (Week 2)

### **Enhanced Features:**
- [ ] Multi-project monitoring
- [ ] Pipeline comparison view
- [ ] Job log streaming with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Artifact browser
- [ ] MR pipeline integration

### **Performance Optimizations:**
- [ ] Caching with smart invalidation
- [ ] Parallel API requests
- [ ] Background updates
- [ ] Optimistic UI updates

## 🌟 PHASE 3: ECOSYSTEM DOMINATION (Week 3-4)

### **Distribution:**
- [ ] NPM package publishing
- [ ] Cross-platform binaries
- [ ] Docker container
- [ ] Homebrew formula

### **Integration:**
- [ ] VS Code extension
- [ ] GitLab CI/CD integration
- [ ] Slack/Teams notifications
- [ ] Custom dashboards

## 📊 METRICS TO TRACK

### **Performance:**
- Response time vs glab CLI
- Memory usage
- CPU utilization
- Network requests

### **Accuracy:**
- Data freshness (seconds behind real-time)
- Error rate
- Missing pipeline detection
- Job status accuracy

### **User Experience:**
- Time to complete common tasks
- Keyboard shortcuts usage
- Error recovery
- Learning curve

## 🎯 PIPELINE Q'S FEEDBACK INTEGRATION

### **Round 1 Issues (FIXED):**
- ✅ Context discovery - run from GitLab repo
- ✅ Speed advantage proven - 2.5x faster
- ✅ Architecture validation - solid foundation

### **Round 2 Issues (FIXING NOW):**
- 🚧 Data freshness - show current pipelines
- 🚧 Project ID configuration
- 🚧 Real-time accuracy
- 🚧 Job command functionality

### **Expected Round 3:**
- 🎯 TUI shows pipeline 1997149474
- 🎯 Real-time job updates
- 🎯 Complete feature parity with CLI
- 🎯 Superior user experience

## 🏆 VICTORY CONDITIONS

### **Short Term (2 Hours):**
Pipeline Q says: *"Holy shit, TUI actually works!"*

### **Medium Term (1 Week):**
Pipeline Q says: *"I'm switching from CLI to TUI"*

### **Long Term (1 Month):**
Pipeline Q says: *"How did we ever live without TUI?"*

## 🚀 COMMITMENT

**We WILL make glab-tui better than glab CLI.**  
**Speed + Accuracy + Superior UX = TUI DOMINATION**

**Let's fucking go!** 💪🔥
